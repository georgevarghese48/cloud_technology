    <h2>What is Docker?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Docker is a containerization software which you can install to help create, manage and run
    containers.</p>
    <p>There are 2 different ways you can go about using and seeing Docker.  The first and the one that
    has been most beneficial is to look at Docker as a software packaging and delivery platform, which
    has been useful for human developers and thus brought about significant recognition for the
    technology.  The second way is to look at Docker as simply lightweight virtual machines.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>What is Kubernetes?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Kubernetes essentially takes containerization technology and boosts its capabilities.  With
    Kubernetes, you're capable of managing numerous containers and running them across multiple compute
    nodes, which could be bare-metal servers or virtual machines.  To paraphrase from the official site of
    Kubernetes, their purpose is to provide an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and
    management of containerized applications.  </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Comparisons?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Although some may believe that there would be competition between both Docker and Kubernetes,
    it turns out it's the opposite.  Both projects have developed into communities that work together
    in order to collaborate and perfect both technologies and the integration between each other. Some
    of the similarities they share are:</p>
    <p>-> Large open-sourced projects</p>
    <p>-> Microservices-based architecture</p>
    <p>-> Mostly written in Go programming language (allows the technology to be shipped as lightweight
    binaries)</p>
